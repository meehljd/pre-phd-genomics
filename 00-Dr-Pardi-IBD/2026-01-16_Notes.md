# Dr. Pardi Call - Question List

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Topic:** IBD + Genomic Foundation Models - Scoping Discussion

---

## Clinical Need

- What clinical decision would benefit most from better genetic prediction?
  - Dr. Tome - sr fellow in IBD
  - Join these:
    - Digital Path vs Dr. Kata & Shung -> spatial transcriptomics + histology
      - personalize drug selection
    - Tapesty with genetically relevent variants
      - try to convince clinitians that genetic should be tested mo
      - currently only used for striking cases (onset at 1 year old, 6 family members, etc)
- What triggers genetic testing after colonoscopy today? What decisions does it inform?
- Where do current approaches fall short? What would a "home run" look like?
- Why isn't it more often
  - insurance coverage spotty
  - hit rate is low
  - just don't think about it.

## Data

- What IBD cohort size is available? (ballpark)
   - Tapestry ICD Browser and ICD K51 - 2,400 patients with whole exome data (Kostas Lazaridis).
   - STRAND IBD Cohort - 364 positives with WES data (2151 controls; 5:1). 
     - [IBD Cohort Design - by IBD Study Coordinators (Chad Rypstra)](https://dev.azure.com/mclm/Rheumatoid%20Arthritis%20Project/_wiki/wikis/project-wiki/26131/IBD-Tapestry-COHORT-Documentation)
       - Drs. Chedid; 
     - [Golden Cohort](https://dev.azure.com/mclm/Rheumatoid%20Arthritis%20Project/_wiki/wikis/project-wiki/29100/Inflammatory-Bowel-Disease)
   - Mayo Clinic Biobank - 954 IBD patients (ICD K51) with WES data
     - [Biobank Browser]([https://hsr-rsc-prod3.mayo.edu:1919/MC_Biobank_Browser/)
- What genomic data exists? (WGS/WES from biobank, clinical panels, PRS?)
- What clinical phenotypes are captured? (Montreal classification, treatment history, outcomes?)
- Existing IRB/research protocols we could leverage?

## Collaboration

- Who else should be involved? (fellows, informaticist, genetics?)
- Who's the day-to-day contact?

## Success & Deliverables

- What does success look like in 12-18 months? (validation study, publication, pilot?)
- What outputs are most valuable? (risk scores, interpretable features, decision tool?)

## Constraints

- Any timeline drivers? (grants, planned studies?)
- Known barriers?

## Scoping Framework (for notes)

| If the need is... | Project shape |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Diagnostic uncertainty (UC vs CD) | Classification model, larger cohort |
| Monogenic/VEO-IBD | Rare variant prediction, smaller/high-stakes |
| Treatment response | Pharmacogenomics, clear clinical utility |
| Severity/prognosis | Complication prediction, guides escalation |
