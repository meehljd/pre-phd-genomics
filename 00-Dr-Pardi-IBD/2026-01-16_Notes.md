# Dr. Pardi Call - Question List

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Topic:** IBD + Genomic Foundation Models - Scoping Discussion

---

## Clinical Need

- What clinical decision would benefit most from better genetic prediction?
- What triggers genetic testing after colonoscopy today? What decisions does it inform?
- Where do current approaches fall short? What would a "home run" look like?

## Data

- What IBD cohort size is available? (ballpark)
- What genomic data exists? (WGS/WES from biobank, clinical panels, PRS?)
- What clinical phenotypes are captured? (Montreal classification, treatment history, outcomes?)
- Existing IRB/research protocols we could leverage?

## Collaboration

- Who else should be involved? (fellows, informaticist, genetics?)
- Who's the day-to-day contact?

## Success & Deliverables

- What does success look like in 12-18 months? (validation study, publication, pilot?)
- What outputs are most valuable? (risk scores, interpretable features, decision tool?)

## Constraints

- Any timeline drivers? (grants, planned studies?)
- Known barriers?

## Scoping Framework (for notes)

| If the need is... | Project shape |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Diagnostic uncertainty (UC vs CD) | Classification model, larger cohort |
| Monogenic/VEO-IBD | Rare variant prediction, smaller/high-stakes |
| Treatment response | Pharmacogenomics, clear clinical utility |
| Severity/prognosis | Complication prediction, guides escalation |
