Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A. started transcription

Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A.
0 minutes 3 seconds0:03
Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A. 0 minutes 3 seconds
We don't have a whole heck of a lot of time today, so I didn't want to go around the horn and do introductions. I was going to ask Matt if if he could do a quick one minute summary of who we have here, but I'm going to try to do that on behalf of him. So Doctor Pardy, my understanding is this is a an initiative or a study that you're looking to do this IBD.
Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A. 0 minutes 22 seconds
Genomics study. So you're the principal, the Pi here. So we'll look to you for some additional insights on what it is that you're trying to achieve and what's going on. Matt had recommended. So Josh is going to take the lead on our technical team.
Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A. 0 minutes 38 seconds
Kind of lead all of our data science and AI scope, make sure that we understand what we need from that perspective. Carl is here as support with him. So Josh and Carl are a pair. They're working together. Mark is from Goodfire, so he was invited in. There's Matt, so he can give me more information here.
Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A. 0 minutes 56 seconds
And then Doctor, I'm sorry, I'm gonna call you Doctor June because I don't want to say your last name wrong. I I got the request to add you to the meeting yesterday, so I've brought you in. And then Doctor Norgan is our digital pathology.
Liudahl, Crystal D., M.B.A. 1 minute 13 seconds
Chief Medical Officer for Mayo Clinic Digital Pathology. So that's the group that's here today and I am in Mayo Clinic Digital Pathology as well. I'm a business administrative partner, so I'll be taking on the role I think of more project management in some form. So I'll be I'll be helping us from a project management perspective. Matt, I know you missed some of.

That anything you want to add there?

Redlon, Matt F.
1 minute 35 seconds1:35
Redlon, Matt F. 1 minute 35 seconds
No, just thank you for getting the team together. Hi, Doctor Pardi. Hi, Doctor Tome. Tome. OK, there we go. Yeah. Nice to meet you. So I think we we don't have to take a lot of time for this, but I but I would really like to start.
1:42
1 minute 42 seconds
I.

Redlon, Matt F.
1 minute 55 seconds1:55
Redlon, Matt F. 1 minute 55 seconds
Building out sort of a product or a project charter Doctor Pardi on you know and and don't take the word charter to be super formal here we're we're more worried about. I would love to have you describe to the team.
Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D. 20 minutes 48 seconds
No, no, I I think, I think I understand. The most simplistic way to approach this right is, is if you had one variant you wanted to predict, you you'd simply, you know, you would kind of look at the signal and you'd probably do a regression or something like that and see, you know, logistic regression and see if you could predict that that variant.

Pardi, Darrell S., M.D.
20 minutes 49 seconds20:49
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 20 minutes 49 seconds
Yeah.

Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D.
21 minutes 6 seconds21:06
Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D. 21 minutes 6 seconds
We can. There's a bunch of different ways to probably approach this with a basket of variance. You know, the question will be is, is actually one part of that basket of variance really driving the association or is it, you know, are they all equal? And I think that can all be parsed apart. So I think.

Pardi, Darrell S., M.D.
21 minutes 13 seconds21:13
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 21 minutes 13 seconds
OK.

Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D.
21 minutes 26 seconds21:26
Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D. 21 minutes 26 seconds
I think I understand. So it's not it's less GWAS and more more going to be just you know probably some form of regression based approach for predicting this is is what I'm I'm getting out of.
Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D. 21 minutes 41 seconds
Out of this discussion.

Pardi, Darrell S., M.D.
21 minutes 43 seconds21:43
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 21 minutes 43 seconds
OK, I'm not a genomics expert, so I'll I'll believe you, but.

Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D.
21 minutes 48 seconds21:48
Norgan, Andrew P., M.D., Ph.D. 21 minutes 48 seconds
Yeah, it just has to do with if you know what you want versus not knowing what you want and and looking for it, I think is the big, the big distinguishing factor there. And you could do both also it would be an option.
21:49
21 minutes 49 seconds
There's.

Pardi, Darrell S., M.D.
21 minutes 53 seconds21:53
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 21 minutes 53 seconds
Yeah.
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 21 minutes 58 seconds
Yeah.
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 22 minutes
Yeah. And that's what I was thinking that simplistically, can we predict and enhance risk of a genetic variant that would?
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 22 minutes 12 seconds
Encourage the clinician to order genetic testing. But then of course I could imagine those 100 genes, if that's what the number is, some are going to be more relevant than others. You know, could we basket the 10 most relevant and look at it that way?

Meehl, Josh D., M.S.
22 minutes 32 seconds22:32
Meehl, Josh D., M.S. 22 minutes 32 seconds
It could could look at Clinvar and only look at you know genes that have been identified as pathogenic, you know have have true causal relationship and and subset versus the GWAS approach which is yeah just anything that's associated with it whether it's causative or not that might be a more narrowed focus and and more clinically relevant of.
Meehl, Josh D., M.S. 22 minutes 51 seconds
We know these are pathogenic. Now we can actually put some sort of, you know, size to like how impactful they are on the downstream diagnosis and then treatment.

Redlon, Matt F.
23 minutes 3 seconds23:03
Redlon, Matt F. 23 minutes 3 seconds
So it's 22 quick thoughts. One anyway see we're gonna run. Are we running out of time at 10 or or do we have that's our top. OK, the the question I have then is.
Redlon, Matt F. 23 minutes 19 seconds
Team, I think we can write up our thoughts and I'd I'd like to turn the transcript for this into A1 pager that kind of talks about, you know, who the players are, what what the scope is of the analysis, what we're trying to accomplish.
Redlon, Matt F. 23 minutes 38 seconds
With the analysis, so sort of a one page summary on that one page. I would love some words from the AI team on what is the, what is the analytic approach or AI approach to actually looking at these two at at the.
Redlon, Matt F. 23 minutes 58 seconds
The core question, there are some studies that I have. I just was in a meeting at JP Morgan earlier in the week where someone was saying they have definitive. They proved that you could predict a genetic variant from an H&E.
Redlon, Matt F. 24 minutes 17 seconds
I can't remember who it was with, but certainly I think that there is going to be published evidence that people are doing this with various variants, right? And showing that you can predict them.
Redlon, Matt F. 24 minutes 33 seconds
That doesn't mean the variants we care about can be predicted from H&E, but in the world I believe it is happening and so we should do a literature review as well to see what's what's happening out there and then some based on that and what we see as far as the scope.
Redlon, Matt F. 24 minutes 53 seconds
Of the analysis and I think also on there, what can we do as far as the data question, Josh, you know, so the 3400 to the 360 or 2400 to the 364 clarifying what filters were applied and then to Doctor Norgan's point, you know we we can either say.
Redlon, Matt F. 25 minutes 13 seconds
Yes, they probably have biopsies. So you know, we can either start doing the work of of actually finding those matching biopsies and slides.
Redlon, Matt F. 25 minutes 28 seconds
Or we can say, Yep, we have those and let's focus on what the analysis would actually look like, how we would think about at A at a cocktail napkin level, doing the work to build the model that will give us the evidence that we need.
Redlon, Matt F. 25 minutes 44 seconds
And build that into a a a clean one pager that we can circulate back to this group, make sure everybody is on board with the high level flow and then I want to run it by Jim and just get support from him for the work within the program and.
Redlon, Matt F. 26 minutes 2 seconds
And then from there we can get the ball rolling and do the work.
Redlon, Matt F. 26 minutes 9 seconds
Any complaints? Tomatoes to throw at that idea or next steps?

Meehl, Josh D., M.S.
26 minutes 18 seconds26:18
Meehl, Josh D., M.S. 26 minutes 18 seconds
Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

Redlon, Matt F.
26 minutes 20 seconds26:20
Redlon, Matt F. 26 minutes 20 seconds
OK. And don't quick, right? Don't we don't have to overdo the one page or just, you know, make it really bullet point oriented and make sure that we're all on the same page, so.
Redlon, Matt F. 26 minutes 32 seconds
Hey Mark, anything like I can see your your in your eyes, I can see the gears turning. So anything from you before we go or just?

Pardi, Darrell S., M.D.
26 minutes 32 seconds26:32
Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 26 minutes 32 seconds
Sounds great.
M

Mark
26 minutes 42 seconds26:42
Mark 26 minutes 42 seconds
I don't think so. That makes sense. The yeah, the data scale question will be interesting to have nailed down, but my mind is spinning with more excitement than than anything else. This sounds very interesting.

Redlon, Matt F.
26 minutes 56 seconds26:56
Redlon, Matt F. 26 minutes 56 seconds
Wonderful. All right. Well, thank you so much. Appreciate the time this morning and look forward to a little discovery here.

Pardi, Darrell S., M.D. 27 minutes 4 seconds
OK, next.

Thank you very much. Very nice to meet everyone.

Redlon, Matt F.
