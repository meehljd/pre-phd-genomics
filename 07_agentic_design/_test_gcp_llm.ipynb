      "This is a classic philosophical question! Here's a breakdown of why the answer is generally considered to be **the egg**:\n",

      "*   **Evolutionary Perspective:** Chickens evolved from earlier bird-like species. There had to be an egg laid by a bird that was *almost* a chicken, with a genetic mutation inside that egg that made the bird that hatched from it the first \"true\" chicken. So, the egg containing the first chicken came before the chicken itself.\n",
      "\n",
