# Example experiment entry:
# - id: "exp-20260109-001"
#   name: "ESM2 Attention Visualization on TP53 Variants"
#   track: "A"
#   phase: "A1"
#
#   hypothesis: "Attention patterns in ESM2 will highlight structurally important residues around variant positions"
#
#   setup:
#     notebook: "01_interpretability/attention_visualization_esm2.ipynb"
#     data: "TP53 variants from ClinVar"
#     model: "ESM2-650M"
#     parameters:
#       layer: 33
#       head_aggregation: "mean"
#
#   results:
#     metrics:
#       attention_entropy: 0.85
#     observations: "Attention concentrates on variant position and surrounding hydrophobic residues"
#     figures: ["01_interpretability/figs/tp53_attention_heatmap.png"]
#
#   status: "completed"
#   started: "2026-01-09"
#   completed: "2026-01-09"
#
#   conclusions: "ESM2 attention is sensitive to variant context, promising for interpretability"
#   next_steps:
#     - "Compare with DNABERT-2 attention patterns"
#     - "Test on pathogenic vs benign variants"
