# Pre-PhD Intensive Study Plan v4 (REVISED - WITH ANCESTRY ROBUSTNESS)
## Nov 2025 - Sep 2026 (10 Months)
### Optimized for your advanced ML background: Master genomics + clinical context + network medicine + competitive landscape + robustness

---

## REVISION NOTES (v4)

**Changes from v3:**
1. **Genomic Foundation Model (GLM) Decision Point:** Removed Evo2-specific implementation. Track A now uses ESM2 (proteins) for learning interpretability fundamentals. Genomic model selection (Enformer, Nucleotide Transformer, or alternatives) deferred to decision point in Track B Phase 2 (Jan 2026) based on usability and performance evaluation.
2. **Ancestry & Confounder Robustness:** Added comprehensive coverage in Track B Phase 1 (3-4 hours exercises + 2.5 hours reading). Includes population stratification, allele frequency confounding, training data bias analysis, and fairness metrics.
3. **Updated time estimates:** Track B now 105-130 hours (was 100-120) to accommodate ancestry work.

## YOUR CURRENT STATE (Recalibrated)

**You already know:**
- ✅ Transformers, BERT fundamentals
- ✅ ESM papers, Enformer
- ✅ Working with ESM2 + proprietary dual-llama encoder-decoder (last token bottleneck architecture)
- ✅ Saliency maps (DL course 2 years ago)
- ✅ Network science fundamentals (Georgia Tech course, Barabasi textbook, Uri Alon regulatory motifs)

**You need to master (Priority order):**
1. ❌ **Genomics domain** - ACMG classification, HPO, phenotype prediction, rare disease workflows, **ancestry robustness**
2. ❌ **Network medicine & systems biology** - PPI networks, network propagation, pathway logic, genotype→phenotype via topology
3. ❌ **Clinical context** - Diagnostic odyssey, Mayo workflows, IRB/regulatory
4. ❌ **Competitive landscape** - DeepRare, AlphaGenome, GenoMAS (June-July 2025)
5. ❌ **HAO multi-agent systems** - Microsoft orchestrator platform
6. ❌ **Prospective study design** - Clinical trial methodology
7. ⚠️ **Attention maps + interpretability** - Apply to your models (can do in parallel)

**This plan structure:**
- **Track A (2-3 weeks):** Interpretability quick-wins (attention maps + SHAP on ESM2 and your encoder-decoder)
- **Track B (10-12 weeks):** Genomics domain + ancestry robustness + network medicine + clinical (heavy focus) **[EXPANDED]**
- **Track C (6-8 weeks):** Competitive analysis + HAO + study design
- **Concurrent:** Weekly competitive papers + integrated projects

## Total Time Investment

- **Track A:** 20-25 hours
- **Track B:** 105-130 hours (expanded from 100-120 to include ancestry + GLM selection)
- **Track C:** 40-50 hours
- **Concurrent projects:** 50-60 hours
- **Weekly paper reading:** 20-30 hours
- **Total:** ~235-295 hours over 40 weeks = 6-7.5 hours/week average (very doable)

**Result:** Deeply prepared, competitive foundation for PhD thesis with network medicine expertise + ancestry robustness

## Final Notes

1. **You're in a unique position**: You have state-of-the-art models (ESM2 + your encoder-decoder + genomic model TBD) + you're embedded at Mayo + you understand ML deeply + **you have network science fundamentals** + **you're addressing ancestry bias proactively**. Your differentiation is network-aware + ancestry-robust + prospective validation.

2. **Genomic model flexibility**: By deferring the genomic foundation model selection to Jan 2026, you can choose based on: (1) latest models released, (2) usability improvements, (3) performance on your specific use cases. This is strategic given the fast-moving field.

3. **Ancestry robustness as differentiator**: Most competitors (DeepRare, AlphaGenome) don't explicitly address ancestry confounding. By building this into your methodology from the start, you create a publication/funding angle around fairness and generalizability.

4. **Pragmatic time management**: ~6-7 hours/week is sustainable alongside Mayo work and GoodFire. Front-load reading during weeks with lighter Mayo commitments.

5. **Continuous feedback**: Share Project 1-2 outputs with Eric Klee lab early (Jan-Feb 2026) to get clinical feedback and refine direction before committing to full thesis approach.

Good luck! 🚀
