# Example question entry:
# - id: "rq-20260109-001"
#   question: "Can network topology features improve variant pathogenicity prediction beyond sequence-only models?"
#
#   status: "exploring"
#   track: "B"
#
#   decomposition:
#     hypothesis: "Variants affecting network hub genes have different pathogenicity patterns than peripheral genes"
#     assumptions:
#       - "PPI network structure captures functional importance"
#       - "Hub genes are more constrained evolutionarily"
#     variables:
#       independent: ["network centrality", "degree", "betweenness"]
#       dependent: ["pathogenicity score", "clinical significance"]
#       confounds: ["gene length", "expression level", "evolutionary conservation"]
#
#   literature:
#     papers_found: 5
#     current_state: "Network medicine shows promise but limited integration with foundation models"
#     gaps:
#       - "No systematic comparison of network features with sequence embeddings"
#       - "Limited ancestry-stratified evaluation"
#
#   feasibility:
#     data: "STRING PPI, ClinVar variants, gnomAD frequencies"
#     methods: "Network propagation, GFM embeddings, logistic regression"
#     time_estimate: "20 hours"
#     risks:
#       - "Network incompleteness may limit signal"
#
#   phd_fit:
#     aim_alignment: "Aim 1 - network-aware variant ranking"
#     novelty: "medium"
#     publication_potential: "Strong if network features add to GFM performance"
